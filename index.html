            <p>
                On today, of all days, I feel especially privileged to be the author of the most successful webcomic in the world. That's right, "Stonelynch, MA" is the undisputed king of online comic strips! Take that, XKCD! Take that, Penny Arcade! Where's your Eisner now, Scott Kurtz? However, it is with great humility that I accept your nomination for emperor of the earth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that we've all agreed that I am the greatest artist to ever live, here is an excerpt from my forthcoming novel:
            </p>
            <p>
                To be, or not to be--that is the question:
                Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
                The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
                Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
                And by opposing end them. To die, to sleep--
                No more--and by a sleep to say we end
                The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
                That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
                Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep--
                To sleep--perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub,
                For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
                When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
                Must give us pause. There's the respect
                That makes calamity of so long life.
                For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
                Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely
                The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
                The insolence of office, and the spurns
                That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
                When he himself might his quietus make
                With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,
                To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
                But that the dread of something after death,
                The undiscovered country, from whose bourn
                No traveller returns, puzzles the will,
                And makes us rather bear those ills we have
                Than fly to others that we know not of?
                Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
                And thus the native hue of resolution
                Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
                And enterprise of great pitch and moment
                With this regard their currents turn awry
                And lose the name of action. -- Soft you now,
                The fair Ophelia! -- Nymph, in thy orisons
                Be all my sins remembered.
            </p>

                Now this is a story all about how
                My life got flipped turned upside down
                And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there
                I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

                In West Philadelphia, born and raised
                On the playground is where I spent most of my days
                Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool
                And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
                When a couple of guys who were up to no good
                Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood
                I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
                And said "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"

                I begged and pleaded with her day after day
                But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
                She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
                I put my Walkman on and said "I might as well kick it"
                First class, yo, this is bad
                Drinkin' orange juice out of a champagne glass
                Is this what the people of Bel-Air livin' like?
                Hmmm, this might be all right
                But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, and all that
                Is this the type of place that they just sent this cool cat?
                I don't think so, I'll see when I get there
                I hope they're prepared for the Prince of Bel-Air

                Well, uh, the plane landed and when I came out
                There was a dude looked like a cop standin' there with my name out
                I ain't tryin' to get arrested yet, I just got here
                I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared
                I whistled for a cab and when it came near
                The license plate said 'Fresh' and it had dice in the mirror
                If anything I could say that this cab was rare
                But I thought "Nah, forget it, yo holmes, to Bel-Air!"

                I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
                And I yelled to the cabbie "Yo holmes, smell ya later"
                Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there
                To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air
