            <p>
                On today, of all days, I feel especially privileged to be the author of the most successful webcomic in the world. That's right, "Stonelynch, MA" is the undisputed king of online comic strips! Take that, XKCD! Take that, Penny Arcade! Where's your Eisner now, Scott Kurtz? However, it is with great humility that I accept your nomination for emperor of the earth.

            <p>
                Now that we've all agreed that I am the greatest artist to ever live, here is an excerpt from my forthcoming novel:
            </p>
            <p>
                To be, or not to be--that is the question:
                Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
                The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
                Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
                And by opposing end them. To die, to sleep--
                No more--and by a sleep to say we end
                The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
                That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
                Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep--
                To sleep--perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub,
                For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
                When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
                Must give us pause. There's the respect
                That makes calamity of so long life.
                For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
                Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely
                The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
                The insolence of office, and the spurns
                That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
                When he himself might his quietus make
                With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,
                To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
                But that the dread of something after death,
                The undiscovered country, from whose bourn
                No traveller returns, puzzles the will,
                And makes us rather bear those ills we have
                Than fly to others that we know not of?
                Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
                And thus the native hue of resolution
                Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
                And enterprise of great pitch and moment
                With this regard their currents turn awry
                And lose the name of action. -- Soft you now,
                The fair Ophelia! -- Nymph, in thy orisons
                Be all my sins remembered.
            </p>
            <p>
              Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
            </p>
            <p>
                But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate—we can not consecrate—we can not hallow—this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

                Now this is a story all about how<br>
                My life got flipped turned upside down<br>
                And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there<br>
                I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air<br>

                In West Philadelphia, born and raised<br>
                On the playground is where I spent most of my days<br>
                Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool<br>
                And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school<br>
                When a couple of guys who were up to no good<br>
                Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood<br>
                I got in one little fight and my mom got scared<br>
                And said "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"<br>

                I begged and pleaded with her day after day<br>
                But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way<br>
                She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket<br>
                I put my Walkman on and said "I might as well kick it"<br>
                First class, yo, this is bad<br>
                Drinkin' orange juice out of a champagne glass<br>
                Is this what the people of Bel-Air livin' like?<br>
                Hmmm, this might be all right<br>
                But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, and all that<br>
                Is this the type of place that they just sent this cool cat?<br>
                I don't think so, I'll see when I get there<br>
                I hope they're prepared for the Prince of Bel-Air<br>

                Well, uh, the plane landed and when I came out<br>
                There was a dude looked like a cop standin' there with my name out<br>
                I ain't tryin' to get arrested yet, I just got here<br>
                I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared<br>
                I whistled for a cab and when it came near<br>
                The license plate said 'Fresh' and it had dice in the mirror<br>
                If anything I could say that this cab was rare<br>
                But I thought "Nah, forget it, yo holmes, to Bel-Air!"<br>

                I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8<br>
                And I yelled to the cabbie "Yo holmes, smell ya later"<br>
                Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there<br>
                To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air
            </p>
            <p>
              Prepare for trouble!<br>
              And make it double!<br>
              To protect the world from devastation!<br>
              To unite all peoples within our nation!<br>
              To denounce the evils of truth and love!<br>
              To extend our reach to the stars above!<br>
              Jessie!<br>
              James!<br>
              Team Rocket blasts off at the speed of light!<br>
              Surrender now, or prepare to fight!<br>
              Meowth!<br>
              That's right!<br>
